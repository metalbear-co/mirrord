mirrord lets developers run local processes in the context of their cloud environment.
Itâ€™s meant to provide the benefits of running your service on a cloud environment (e.g. staging) without actually
going through the hassle of deploying it there, and without disrupting the environment by deploying untested code.
It comes as a Visual Studio Code extension, an IntelliJ plugin and a CLI tool. You can read more about it [here](https://mirrord.dev/docs/overview/introduction/).

## CLI Tool

### Installation

You can use either

```sh
brew install metalbear-co/mirrord/mirrord
```

or

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

- Windows isn't currently supported (you can use WSL)

### How To Use

```sh
mirrord exec <process command> --target <target-path>
```

e.g.

```sh
mirrord exec node app.js --target pod/my-pod
```

---

## How It Works

When you select a pod to impersonate, mirrord launches a pod on the same node as the pod you selected.
The new pod is then used to connect your local process and the impersonated pod: it mirrors incoming traffic from the pod to your process,
routes outgoing traffic from your process through the pod, and does the same for file reads, file writes, and environment variables.
You can read more about it [here](https://mirrord.dev/docs/overview/introduction/).

### Additional capabilities

Container run inside the pod launched by mirrord requires additional [Linux capabilities](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html):

- `CAP_NET_ADMIN` - for modifying routing tables
- `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` - for reading target pod environment
- `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` - for joining target pod network namespace
