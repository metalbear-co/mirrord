mirrord lets developers run local processes in the context of their cloud environment. It‚Äôs meant to provide the benefits of running your service on a cloud environment (e.g. staging) without actually going through the hassle of deploying it there, and without disrupting the environment by deploying untested code. It comes as a Visual Studio Code extension, an IntelliJ plugin and a CLI tool. You can read more about it [here](https://mirrord.dev/docs/overview/introduction/).

## Getting Started
- [VS Code Extension](#vs-code-extension)
- [IntelliJ Plugin](#intellij-plugin)
- [CLI Tool](#cli-tool)
> mirrord uses your machine's default kubeconfig for access to the Kubernetes API.

## IntelliJ Plugin
### Installation
Get the plugin [here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19772-mirrord).

## CLI Tool
### Installation
```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

* Windows isn't currently supported (you can use WSL)

### How To Use
```sh
mirrord exec <process command> --pod-name <name of the pod to impersonate>
```
e.g. 

```sh
mirrord exec node app.js --pod-name my-pod
```

---

## How It Works
When you select a pod to impersonate, mirrord launches a privileged pod on the same node as the pod you selected. The new pod is then used to connect your local process and the impersonated pod: it mirrors incoming traffic from the pod to your process, routes outgoing traffic from your process through the pod, and does the same for file reads, file writes, and environment variables. You can read more about it [here](https://mirrord.dev/docs/overview/introduction/).
