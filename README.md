mirrord lets you easily mirror traffic from your Kubernetes cluster to your development environment. It comes as both [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension and a CLI tool.

## Getting Started
- [VSCode Extension](#vscode-extension)
- [CLI Tool](#cli-tool)
> mirrord uses your machine's default kubeconfig for access to the Kubernetes API.

> Make sure your local process is listening on the same port as the remote pod.

## CLI Tool
### Installation
```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

* Windows isn't supported currently (you can use WSL)

### How to use
```sh
mirrord exec <process command> --pod-name <name of the pod to impersonate>
```
e.g. 

```sh
mirrord exec node app.js --pod-name my-pod
```

## How it works
mirrord works by letting you select a pod to mirror traffic from. It launches a privileged pod on the same nodewhich enters the namespace of the selected pod and captures traffic from it.
