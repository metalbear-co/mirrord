# release.sh
#
# This script automates the process of preparing a new release for mirrord.
#
# Usage:
#   ./release.sh 1.234.5
#
# Requirements:
# - `git`
# - `cargo-set` for setting workspace package version
# - `towncrier` for changelog generation
#
# What this script does:
# - Checkout a new branch and use the release version as the name of the branch.
# - Bump workspace version in `Cargo.toml`.
# - Prepare changelog using `towncrier`.
# - Push the branch to remote.
#
# Continue with the following steps after running this script:
# - Create a PR and merge it into mirrord main.
# - Create a new Github release with a new tag. This triggers the `Release` workflow.
#     - Use the new version for the tag and release name.
#     - Use the changelog as the release description excluding the `Internal` section.
# - Once the workflow finishes, adjust environment variables in our analytics server.
