Fix new IDE progress breaking older plugins.
Three issues fixed:
1. Show the new progress only when env var is set (to be set in newer IDE versions).
2. Multi pod warning was showing everytime when no operator, not only when targetting a deployment + no operator.
3. Show the message for rollouts as well.
