Changed port stealing configuration:
1. Added new `port` field to the `incoming` configuration. The field lists ports that should be stolen/mirrored. Other ports remain local.
2. Changed the way `incoming.http_filter.ports` field is interpreted. Ports not listed in this field are not stolen, unless listed in `incoming.ports`.
