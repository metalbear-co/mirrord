Add fs mapping, under `feature.fs.mapping` now it's possible to specify regex match and replace for paths while running mirrord exec.

Example:

```toml
[feature.fs.mapping]
"/var/app/temp" = "/tmp" # Will replace all calls to read/write/scan for "/var/app/temp/sample.txt" to "/tmp/sample.txt"
"/var/app/.cache" = "/workspace/mirrord$0" # Will replace "/var/app/.cache/sample.txt" to "/workspace/mirrord/var/app/.cache/sample.txt" see [Regex::replace](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/struct.Regex.html#method.replace)
```
