Refactor file ops open/read/close to allow us to directly manipulate the remote file (in agent) withouht going through C (mainly used to not leak the remote file due to how gethostname works).

Change dup to take an argument that signals if we should change the fd from SOCKETS to OPEN_FILES (or vice-versa).
