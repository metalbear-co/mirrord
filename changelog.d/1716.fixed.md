Try to resolve an issue where internal proxy is under heavy load since bash scripts does a lot of fork/exec by:
1. Not blocking the process we load into until we get the connection - that happens in the background.
2. Increasing internal proxy's listen backlog (might not help on macOS)
3. Change internal proxy to create the upstream (agent) connection in a different task, allowing it to keep accepting.
