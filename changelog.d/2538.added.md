`LayerTcpSteal` already provides `http_filter` so we can use similar logic for the mirrord type. 
To keep it changed `PortSubscribe(Port)` to `PortSubscribe(MirrorType)` should be best, so I have created a new type same as Steal that will split the logic filters/no filters. 

Added incoming feature I added `MirrorFiltered` which is similar to how Steal works, maybe this can be just called `Mirror` and also provide filter settings to it but make them optional because currently Mirror is returned as default if no filters are provided. 

For the tests created a new mirror mod and added couple of tests similar to the steal ones. 

Also changes to the parts of the code that need to use the `MirrorType`.
