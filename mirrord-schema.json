Case insensitive. 1. read_write - List of patterns that should be read/write remotely. 2. read_only - List of patterns that should be read only remotely. 3. local - List of patterns that should be read locally.\n\nThe logic for choosing the behavior is as follows: 1. Check if one of the patterns match the file path, do the corresponding action. There's no specified order if two lists match the same path, we will use the first one (and we do not guarantee what is first). Note: Specifying the same path in two lists is unsupported and can lead to undefined behaviour. 2. Check our \"special list\" - we have an internal at compile time list for different behavior based on patterns    to provide better UX. 3. If none of the above match, use the default behavior (mode).\n\n## Examples\n\n- Read `/lib` locally, `/etc` remotely and `/var/run` read write remotely.
