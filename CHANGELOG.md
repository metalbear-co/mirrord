# Change Log

All notable changes to the mirrord's cli, agent, protocol, extensions will be documented in this file.
Previous versions had CHANGELOG per component, we decided to combine all repositories to a mono-repo with one CHANGELOG.

Check [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) for recommendations on how to structure this file.

## [Unreleased]

## Changed
- Don't report InProgress io error as error (log as info)

## 3.0.19-alpha

### Added
- Release image for armv7 (Cloud ARM)

### Fixed
- Release for non-amd64 arch failed because of lack of QEMU step in the github action. Re-added it

  Addresses but does not
  close [[#472](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/472)] (more integration tests still needed).

### Fixed

## 2.8.1

### Fixed
- CI - remove usage of ubuntu-18.04 machines (deprecated)

### Added
- E2E - add basic env tests for bash scripts

### Fixed
- mirrord-agent - Update pcap library, hopefully will fix dropped packets (syn sometimes missed in e2e).
- mirrord-agent/layer - Sometimes layer tries to connect to agent before it finsihed loading, even though pod is running. Added watching the log stream for a "ready" log message before attempting to connect.

### Changed

- E2E - Don't delete pod/service on failure, instead leave them for debugging.
- mirrord-agent - Don't use `tokio::spawn` for spawning `sniffer` (or any other namespace changing task) to avoid namespace-clashing/undefined behavior. Possibly fixing bugs.
- Change the version check on the VS Code extension to happen when mirrord is enabled rather than when the IDE starts up.


## 2.7.0

### Added
- mirrord-layer: You can now pass `MIRRORD_AGENT_COMMUNICATION_TIMEOUT` as environment variable to control agent timeout.
- Expand file system operations with `access` and `faccessat` hooks for absolute paths

### Fixed

- mirrord-layer: Add a sleep on closing local socket after receiving close to let local application respond before closing.
- mirrord-layer: Fix DNS issue where `ai_addr` would not live long enough (breaking the remote DNS feature).

### Changed

- reduce e2e flakiness (add message sent on tcp listen subscription, wait for that message)
- reduce e2e flakiness - increase timeout time
- mirrord-layer - increase agent creation timeout (to reduce e2e flakiness on macOS)
- E2E - Don't do file stuff on http traffic to reduce flakiness (doesn't add any coverage value..)
- mirrord-layer - Change tcp mirror tunnel `select` to be biased so it flushes all data before closing it (better testing, reduces e2e flakiness)
- E2E - unify resolve_node_host for linux and macOS with support for wsl provided Docker & Kubernetes
- E2E - add `trace` for tests to have paramaterized arguments printed
- mirrord-agent - add debug print of args to identify runs

- Add a flag for the agent, `--ephemeral-container`, to correctly refer to the filesystem i.e. refer to root path as `/proc/1/root` when the flag is on, otherwise `/`.
- Add support for Golang on amd64 (x86-64).

### Changed
- Assign a random port number instead of `61337`. (Reason: A forking process creates multiple agents sending traffic on the same port, causing addrinuse error.)
- `mirrord-layer/socket` now uses `socket2::SockAddr` to comply with Rust's new IP format.

### Fixed
- Fix filesystem tests to only run if the default path exists.
- Fix extension not running due to the node_modules directory not being packaged.

## 2.5.0

### Added
- New feature, [remote DNS resolving](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/27#issuecomment-1154072686).
It is now possible to use the remote's `addrinfo` by setting the `MIRRORD_REMOTE_DNS` variable to
`true`, or using the `-d` option in mirrord-cli.
- New feature, [Ephemeral Containers](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/172).
Use Kubernetes beta feature `Ephemeral Containers` to mirror traffic with the `--ephemeral-container` flag.
- E2E tests on macos for Golang using the Gin framework.

### Changed

- Changed `addrinfo` to `VecDeque` - fixes a potential bug (loss of order)

## 2.4.1

### Added
- mirrord-cli `exec` subcommand accepts `--extract-path` argument to set the directory to extract the library to. Used for tests mainly.
- mirrord-layer provides `MIRRORD_IMPERSONATED_CONTAINER_NAME` environment variable to specify container name to impersonate. mirrord-cli accepts argument to set variable.
- vscode-ext provides quick-select for setting `MIRRORD_IMPERSONATED_CONTAINER_NAME`

### Changed
- Refactor e2e, enable only Node HTTP mirroring test.
- E2E: add macOS to E2E, support using minikube by env var.
- E2E: Skip loading to docker before loading to minikube (load directly to minikube..)
- layer: Environment variables now load before process starts, no more race conditions.

### Fixed

- Don't fail environment variable request if none exists.
- E2E: Don't assert jobs and pods length, to allow better debugging and less flakiness.
- Refactor(agent) - Main loop doesn't pass messages around but instead spawned peers interact directly with tcp sniffer. Renamed Peer -> Client and ClientID.
- Add context to agent/job creation errors (Fixes #112)
- Add context to stream creation error (Fixes #110)
- Change E2E to use real app, closes [#149](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/149)

## 2.3.0

### Added

- E2E small improvements, removing sleeps. (Fixes #99)

## 2.2.0

### Added

- File operations are now available behind the `MIRRORD_FILE_OPS` env variable, this means that mirrord now hooks into the following file functions: `open`, `fopen`, `fdopen`, `openat`, `read`, `fread`, `fileno`, `lseek`, and `write` to provide a mirrored file system.
- Support for running x64 (Intel) binary on arm (Silicon) macOS using mirrord. This will download and use the x64 mirrord-layer binary when needed.

- Mono repo
- Fixed unwraps inside of [agent-creation](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/blob/main/mirrord-layer/src/lib.rs#L75), closes [#191](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/191)
