# Change Log

All notable changes to the mirrord's cli, agent, protocol, extensions will be documented in this file.
Previous versions had CHANGELOG per component, we decided to combine all repositories to a mono-repo with one CHANGELOG.

Check [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) for recommendations on how to structure this file.

- Added a graceful exit for system paths that do not exist.

## 2.1.0

- Prompt user to update if their version is outdated in the VS Code extension or CLI.
- Set `MIRRORD_CHECK_VERSION` to false to make E2E tests not read update messages. 

## 2.0.0

## 2.0.4
Complete refactor and re-write of everything.
- The CLI/VSCode extension now use `mirrord-layer` which loads into debugged process using `LD_PRELOAD`/`DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`.
