  from remote files.
  [#2069](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/2069)

- Added SQS splitting state to mirrord operator status reporting (requires operator support).


### Changed

- Hidden files and directories in `$HOME` directory are now read locally by
  default.


### Fixed

- Can now run cs-installed sbt. We now only need to be able to parse the first
  line of a script, so we now support scripts like that sbt, which starts with
  a normal shebang but then has text in a weird encoding, or maybe non-textual
  data. [#2947](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/2947)
- Prevent reverse port forwarding from ending unexpectedly due to
  unexpected connection end.
  [#2962](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/2962)

- use `Stdio::null()` for "sidecar start" patch added in
  [#2933](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/pull/2933).

## [3.125.2](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/tree/3.125.2) - 2024-11-29


### Fixed

- Added notice that fs mapping does not apply to relative paths.
  [#2894](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/2894)

### Changed

- Ignore paths that start with the current dir path, instead of any path that
  contains the current dir path. Also, ignore only paths that end with the
  current exe's path, not all that contain it.
- Print a warning to the user when `-p` is provided as part of `mirrord container`
  run command, as it may cause issues because of our usage of
  container type network mode.


### Fixed

- Change `getifaddrs` hook to allocate memory for a new list instead of modifying
  list returned from libc call.
  [#2903](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/2903)
- Read current dir, current exe, and temp dir locally, also when they contain
  characters with a meaning for regexes, like e.g. paretheses.

### Added

- Add new api to run mirrord inside container

  ```
  mirrord container [options] -- <docker/podman> run ...
  ```

  Because we need to run internal proxy process on the same network as the
  process loaded with `mirrord-layer`, to keep config and kubernetes
  comparability the communication to mirrord agent is made via external proxy
  that will run on the host machine.
  ```

### Fixed

- Add custom handling for istio ambient mode where we set

- Update actions
- Update the location of `--` in container command
  ```
  mirrord container [options] <docker/podman/nerdctl> run -- ...
  ```
  Now will be
  ```
  mirrord container [options] -- <docker/podman/nerdctl> run ...
  ```
  or simply
  ```
  mirrord container [options] <docker/podman/nerdctl> run ...
  ```

  mirrord always uses the operator and aborts in case of failure. If the option
  is set to `false`, mirrord does not attempt to use the operator. If the
  option is not set at all, mirrord attempts to use the operator, but does not
  abort in case it could not be found.
- Fixed config verification in IDE context when `copy_target` feature is used.

### Internal

- CI Improvements:
  - Unify lint and integration for macOS to save cache and runner.
  - Remove trace logging from integration tests on macos
  - use node 18 for testing since installing 19 in CI takes hours.
  - remove `build_mirrord` job - quite useless as it's used only in other
  workflow, so have it there and re-use cache
    also save some cache,
  - specify target for all cargo invocations to re-use cache efficiently.
  - fix flake with node server closing before time
- Fix regression in kube api blocking operator from compiling
- Reorganize the CI with the following objective of unifying as much as we can
  CI that can run on the same host, this is to have less caches and have better
  compilation time (as there's overlap). Things done:

  - Remove the build layer CI, since we now have an integration tests that
  check it + clippy for aarch darwin / Linux
  - Make clippy run for all of the project for aarch64 linux instead of agent
  only
  - Revert removal of Rust cache from e2e (was by mistake)
  - Don't use "cache" for other Gos since it will try to overwrite and have bad
  results.

- Changed CLI progress to print warnings and not only set it as the last
  message of progress
- Changed config verify to return aggregated warnings list for user to print
  instead of warn in current progress - can fix issues with extension where we
  printed to stderr.

- Small changes relevant to operator for #1782.


### Fixed

- Fixed environment on ephemeral container
  This is done by two things:

  1. There was an issue where we used `self` instead of `1` to obtain env based
  on pid.
  2. We didn't have container runtime to use for fetching, so now we also copy
  env from the original pod spec and set it to ours.
  [#1818](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1818)


### Internal

  scripts does a lot of fork/exec by:
  1. Increasing internal proxy's listen backlog (might not help on macOS)

  macos). [#1458](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1458)
- Add new rule to the OUTPUT chain of iptables in agent to support kubectl

## [3.47.0](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/tree/3.47.0) - 2023-06-20


### Added

- Added `listen_ports` to `incoming` config to control what port is actually
  being used locally
  so mirrored/stolen ports can still be accessed locally via those. If port
  provided by `listen_ports`
  isn't available, application will receive `EADDRINUSE`.
  Example configuration:
  ```json
  {
      "feature":
      {
          "incoming": {
              "listen_ports": [[80, 7111]]
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  will make port 80 available on 7111 locally, while stealing/mirroring port
  80. [#1554](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1554)


### Changed

- Changed the logic of choosing local port to use for intercepting mirror/steal
  sockets
  now instead of assigning a random port always, we try to use the original one
  and if we fail we assign random port.
  This only happens if `listen_ports` isn't used.
  [#1554](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1554)
- The path `/opt` itself is read locally by default (up until now paths inside
  that directory were read locally by default, but not the directory itself).
  [#1570](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1570)
- Changed back required IntelliJ version to 222+ from 223+
- Moved VSCode extension to its own repository and versioning

### Added

- Support for targetless execution: when not specifying any target for the
  agent, mirrord now spins up an independent agent. This can be useful e.g. if

- fix using config with WSL on JetBrains
  [#1210](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1210)
- Fix internal proxy exiting before IntelliJ connects to it in some situations

  waiting from the extension call to the child.
  [#1211](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1211)
- mirrord-cli: update cli so failing to use operator will fallback to
  no-operator mode.

- Change OPEN_FILES from Mutex HashMap to just using DashMap.
  [#1206](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1206)
- Refactor file ops open/read/close to allow us to directly manipulate the
  remote file (in agent) withouht going through C (mainly used to not leak the
  remote file due to how gethostname works).

  Change dup to take an argument that signals if we should change the fd from
  SOCKETS to OPEN_FILES (or vice-versa).
  [#1202](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1202)




## [3.33.0](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/tree/3.33.0) - 2023-03-22

### Changed

- change outgoing connection drop to be trace instead of error since it's not
  an error


### Fixed

- Support stealing on meshed services with ports specified in
  --skip-inbound-ports on linkerd and itsio equivalent.
  [#1041](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1041)


## [3.32.2](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/tree/3.32.2) - 2023-03-14


### Fixed

- fix microk8s support by adding possible containerd socket path
  [#1186](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1186)
- fix gethostname null termination missing
  [#1189](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1189)

  dependency).
  also trace logs to not log the data.
  [#1178](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1178)
- fix environment regression by mixing the two approaches together.
  priority is proc > oci (via container api)
  [#1180](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1180)


### Internal

- compile/test speed improvements

  1. add CARGO_NET_GIT_FETCH_WITH_CLI=true to agent's Dockerfile since we found
  out it
      saves a lot of time on fetching (around takes 60s when using libgit2)
  2. change `rust-toolchain.toml` so it won't auto install unneeded targets
  always
  3. remove `toolchain: nightly` parameter from `actions-rs/toolchain@v1` since
  it's
      not needed because we have `rust-toolchain.toml`
      saves a lot of time on fetching (takes around 60s when using libgit2)
  4. switch to use `actions-rust-lang/setup-rust-toolchain@v1` instead of
  `actions-rs/toolchain@v1`
      since it's deprecated and doesn't support `rust-toolchain.toml`
  5. remove s`Swatinem/rust-cache@v2` since it's included in
  `actions-rust-lang/setup-rust-toolchain@v1`
  6. use latest version of `Apple-Actions/import-codesign-certs` to remove
  warnings
- print logs of stealer/sniffer start failure
- run docker/containerd runtime at the same time to make e2e faster
- use base images for agent to reduce build time


## [3.32.0](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/tree/3.32.0) - 2023-03-08


### Changed

- mirrord-layer: changed result of `getsockname` to return requested socket on
  `bind` instead of the detoured socket address
  [#1047](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1047)
- mirrord-layer: Added `SocketId` to `UserSocket` as a better way of
  identifying sockets, part of #1054.
  [#1054](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1054)
- CHANGELOG - changed to use towncrier
- Change socket error on reading from outgoing sockets and mirror to be info
  instead of error


### Fixed

- Possible bug when bound address is bypassed and socket stays in `SOCKETS`
  map.


### Internal

- Change release.yaml so pushing final tags will occur only on real releases
  while manual releases will push into `ghcr.io/metalbear-co/mirrord-staging:
  ${{ github.sha }}`
  so we can leverage github CI for testing images.
- Don't build builder image as part of the build, use a prebuilt image -
  improve cd time
  Use `taiki-e/install-action` instead of `cargo install` (compiles from
  source) for installing `cross`.
- Fix broken aarch build


## 3.31.0

### Added

- config: `ignore_localhost` to `outgoing` config for ignoring localhost connections, meaning it will connect to local
  instead of remote localhost.
- config: `ignore_localhost` to `incoming` config for ignoring localhost bound sockets, meaning it will not steal/mirror those.
- combination of `ignore_localhost` in `incoming` and `outgoing` can be useful when you run complex processes that does
  IPC over localhost.
- `sip_binaries` to config file to allow specifying SIP-protected binaries that needs to be patched
  when mirrord doesn't detect those. See [#1152](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1152).

### Fixed

- Unnecessary error logs when running a script that uses `env` in its shebang.
- VSCode extension: running Python script with debugger fails because it tries to connect to the debugger port remotely.
- Big file leading to timeout: we found out that `bincode` doesn't do so well with large chunked messages
  so we limited remote read size to 1 megabyte, and read operation supports getting partial data until EOF.
- mirrord-operator: fix silent fail when parsing websocket messages fails.

### Changed

- improved mirrord cli help message.
- mirrord-config: Change `flush_connections` default to `true`, related to
  [#1029](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1029).

## 3.30.0

### Added

- mirrord-layer: Added `port_mapping` under `incoming` configuration to allow mapping local ports to custom
  remote port, for example you can listen on port 9999 locally and it will steal/mirror
  the remote 80 port if `port_mapping: [[9999, 80]]`. See [#1129](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1129)

### Fixed

- Fix issue when two (or more) containerd sockets exist and we use the wrong one. Fixes [#1133](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1133).
- Invalid toml in environment variables configuration examples.

### Changed

- Use container's runtime env instead of reading it from `/proc/{container_root_pid}/environ` as some processes (such as nginx) wipe it. Fixes [#1135](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1135)
- Removed the prefix "test" from all test names - [#1065](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1065).
- Created symbolic link from the vscode directory to the `LICENSE` and `CHANGELOG.md` files so that mirrord developers
  don't need to copy them there before building the app.
- mirrord-layer: `socket` hook will now block ipv6 requests and will return EAFNOSUPPORT. See [#1121](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1121).

## 3.29.0

### Added

- mirrord debug feature (for mirrord developers to debug mirrord): Cause the agent to exit early with an error.
- mirrord E2E tests: support for custom namespaces.

### Fixed

- Unpause the target container before exiting if the agent exits early on an error and the container is paused -
   [#1111](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1111).
- intellij-plugin: fix issue where execution hangs when running using Gradle. Fixes [#1120](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1120).
- intellij-plugin: fix issue where mirrord doesn't load into gradle, was found when fixing [#1120](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1120).
- mirrord-agent: reintroduce `-o lo` back to iptable rules to prevent issue where outinging messags could be intersepted by mirrord as incoming ones.
- mirrord-layer: binding same port on different IPs leads to a crash due to `ListenAlreadyExists` error.
  This is now ignored with a `info` message since we can't know if the IP/Port was already bound
  or not. Created a follow up issue to complete implementation and error at application's bind.

## 3.28.4

### Fixed

- VSCode Extension: Fix wrong CLI path on Linux

## 3.28.3

### Fixed

- VSCode Extension: Fix wrong CLI path

## 3.28.2

### Fixed

- Fix error in VSCode extension compilation

## 3.28.1

### Fixed

- CI: fix error caused by missing dir

## 3.28.0

### Changed

- Change VSCode extension to package all binaries and select the correct one based on the platform. Fixes [#1101](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1101).
- agent: add log to error when handling a client message fails.

### Fixed

- agent: Make sniffer optional to support cases when it's not available and mirroring is not required.

## 3.27.1

### Changed

- Update operator version

## 3.27.0

### Fixed

- mirrord now handles it when the local app closes a forwarded stolen tcp connection instead of exiting with an error. Potential fix for [#1063](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1063).
- missing kubeconfig doesn't fail extensions (it failed because it first tried to resolve the default then used custom one)

### Changed

- layer: Don't print error when tcp socket faces error as it can be a normal flow.
- internal proxy - set different timeout for `mirrord exec` and running from extension
  fixing race conditions when running from IntelliJ/VSCode.
- Changed `with_span_events` from `FmtSpan::Active` to `FmtSpan::NEW | FmtSpan::CLOSE`.
  Practically this means we will have less logs on enter/exit to span and only when it's first created
  and when it's closed.
- JetBrains Plugin: Add debug logs for investigating user issues.
- JetBrains compatability: set limit from 222 (2022.2.4) since 221 isn't supported by us.
- Make `kubeconfig` setting effective always by using `-f` in `mirrord ls`.
- mirrord agent can now run without sniffer, will not be able to mirror but can still steal.
  this is to enable users who have older kernel (4.20>=) to use the steal feature.

## 3.26.1

### Fixed

- VSCode Extension: Prevent double prompting of the user to select the target if not specified in config. See [#1080](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1080).

### Changed

- JetBrains enable support from 2021.3 (like we had in 3.14.3).

## 3.26.0

### Changed

- mirrord-agent: localhost traffic (like healthprobes) won't be stolen by mirrord on meshed targets to allign behavior with non meshed targets. See [#1070](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/pull/1070)
- Filter out agent pods from `mirrord ls`, for better IDE UX. Closes [#1045](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1045).
- Not exiting on SIP-check fail. Instead, logging an error and letting the program fail as it would without mirrord.
  See [#951](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/951).

### Fixed

- Fix cache does not work on test-agent workflow. See [#251](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/251).
- CI: merge queue + branch protection issues

## 3.25.0

### Added

- `gethostname` detour that returns contents of `/etc/hostname` from target pod. See relevant [#1041](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1041).

### Fixed

- `getsockname` now returns the **remote** local address of the socket, instead of the
  **local fake** address of the socket.
  This should fix issues with Akka or other software that checks the local address and
  expects it to match the **local ip of the pod**.
  This breaks agent protocol (agent/layer need to match).
- GoLand debug fails because of reading `/private/var/folders` remotely (trying to access self file?). fixed with filter change (see below)

### Changed

- VSCode extension: update dialog message
- JetBrains: can now change focus from search field to targets using tab/shift+tab (for backwrad)
- Refactor - mirrord cli now spawns `internal proxy` which does the Kubernetes operations for
  the layer, so layer need not interact with k8s (solves issues with remote/local env mix)
- filter: add `/private/var/folders" to default local read override
- filter: fixed regex for `/tmp` default local read override
- disable flask e2e until we solve the glibc issue (probably fstream issue)

## 3.24.0

### Added

- Add a field to mirrord-config to specify custom path for kubeconfig , resolves [#1027](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1027).

### Changed

- Removed limit on future builds `untilBuild` in JetBrains plugin.
- IntelliJ-ext: change the dialog to provide a sorted list and make it searchable, resolves [#1031](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1031).
- mirrord-layer: Changed default to read AWS credentials + config from remote pod.
- Removed unused env var (`MIRRORD_EXTERNAL_ENV`)
- mirrord-agent: Use `conntrack` to flush stealer connections (temporary fix for
  [#1029](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1029)).

### Fixed

- Added env guard to be used in cli + extension to prevent (self) misconfigurations (our kube settings being used from remote).

## 3.23.0

### Fixed

- mirrord-config: Fix disabled feature for env in config file, `env = false` should work. See [#1015](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1015).
- VS Code extension: release universal extension as a fallback for Windows and other platforms to be used with WSL/Remote development. Fixes [#1017](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/1017)
- Fix `MIRRORD_AGENT_RUST_LOG` can't be more than info due to dependency on info log.
- Fix pause feature not working in extension due to writing to stdout (changed to use trace)

### Changed

- `DNSLookup` failures changed to be info log from error since it is a common case.
- mirrord-agent: now prints "agent ready" instead of logging it so it can't be fudged with `RUST_LOG` control.
- mirrord-agent: `agent::layer_recv` changed instrumentation to be trace instead of info.
- mirrord-layer/agent: change ttl of job to be 1 second for cases where 0 means in cluster don't clean up.
- Convert go fileops e2e tests into integration tests. Part of
  [#994](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/994#issuecomment-1410721960).

## 3.22.0

### Changed

- Rust: update rust toolchain (and agent rust `DOCKERFILE`) to `nightly-2023-01-31`.
- exec/spawn detour refactor [#999](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/999).
- mirrord-layer: Partialy load mirrord on certian processes that spawn other processes to allow sip patch on the spawned process.
  This to prevent breaking mirrord-layer load if parent process is specified in `--skip-processes`.  (macOS only)

### Fixed

- mirrord-layer: DNS resolving doesn't work when having a non-OS resolver (using UDP sockets)
  since `/etc/resolv.conf` and `/etc/hosts` were in the local read override,
  leading to use the local nameserver for resolving. Fixes [#989](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/989)
- mirrord-agent: Infinite reading a file when using `fgets`/`read_line` due to bug seeking to start of file.
- Rare deadlock on file close that caused the e2e file-ops test to sometimes fail
  ([#994](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/994)).

## 3.21.0

### Added

- Support for Go's `os.ReadDir` on Linux (by hooking the `getdents64` syscall). Part of
  [#120](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/120).
- Test mirrord with Go 1.20rc3.

### Changed

- mirrord-agent: Wrap agent with a parent proccess to doublecheck the clearing of iptables. See [#955](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/955)
- mirrord-layer: Change `HOOK_SENDER` from `Option` to `OnceLock`.

### Fixed

- mirrord-agent: Handle HTTP upgrade requests when the stealer feature is enabled
  (with HTTP traffic) PR [#973](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/pull/973).
- E2E tests compile on MacOS.
- mirrord could not load into some newer binaries of node -
  [#987](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/987). Now hooking also `posix_spawn`, since node now uses
  `libuv`'s `uv_spawn` (which in turn calls `posix_spawn`) instead of libc's `execvp` (which calls `execve`).
- Read files from the temp dir (defined by the system's `TMPDIR`) locally, closes
  [#986](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/986).

## 3.20.0

### Added

- Support impersonation in operator

### Fixed

- Go crash in some scenarios [#834](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/834).

  help message.
- Bug: SIP would fail the second time to run scripts for which the user does not have write permissions.

### Changed

- Change layer/cli logs to be to stderr instead of stdout to avoid mixing with the output of the application. Closes [#786](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/786)

## 3.19.2

### Changed

- Code refactor: moved all file request and response types into own file.

## 3.19.1

### Fixed

- Changelog error failing the JetBrains release.

## 3.19.0

### Changed

- mirrord-operator: replace operator api to use KubernetesAPI extension. [#915](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/pull/915)

### Fixed

- macOS x64/SIP(arm): fix double hooking `fstatat$INODE64`. Possible crash and undefined behavior.

### Added

- introduce `mirrord-console` - a utility to debug and investigate mirrord issues.

### Deprecated

- Remove old fs mode
  - cli: no `--rw` or `--no-fs`.
  - layer: no `MIRRORD_FILE_OPS`/`MIRRORD_FILE_RO_OPS`/`MIRRORD_FILE_FILTER_INCLUDE`/`MIRRORD_FILE_FILTER_EXCLUDE`

## 3.18.0

### Added

- Agent now sends error encountered back to layer for better UX when bad times happen. (This only applies to error happening on connection-level).
- Partial ls flow for Go on macOS (implemented `fdopendir` and `readdir_r`). Closes [#902](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/902)
- New feature: HTTP traffic filter!
  - Allows the user to steal HTTP traffic based on HTTP request headers, for example `Client: me` would steal requests that match this header,
    while letting unmatched requests (and non-HTTP packets) through to their original destinations.

### Fixed

- Update the setup-qemu-action action to remove a deprecation warning in the Release Workflow
- stat functions now support directories.
- Possible bugs with fds being closed before time (we now handle dup'ing of fds, and hold those as ref counts)

### Changed

- Error on specifying namespace in configuration without path (pod/container/deployment). Closes [#830](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/830)
- IntelliJ plugin with new UI enabled now shows buttons. Closes [#881](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/881)
- Fix deprecation warnings (partially), update checkout action to version 3.

### Changed

## 3.15.2

### Added

- Logging for IntelliJ plugin for debugging/bug reports.

### Fixed

- Crash when mirroring and state is different between local and remote (happens in Mesh).

## 3.14.0

### Changed

- cli: Set environment variables from cli to spawned process instead of layer when using `mirrord exec`.

### Changed

- Adjust filters - all directory filters also filter the directory itself (for when lstat/stating the directory).
  Added `/Applications`

## 3.13.3

### Added

- Add `mirrord ls` which allows listing target path. Hidden from user at the moment, as for now it's meant for extension use only.

### Changed

- Refactor e2e tests: split into modules based on functionality they test.
- internal refactor in mirrord-agent: Stealer feature changed from working per connection to now starting with
  the agent itself ("global"). Got rid of `steal_worker` in favor of a similar abstraction to what
  we have in `sniffer.rs` (`TcpConnectionStealer` that acts as the traffic stealing task, and
  `TcpStealerApi` which bridges the communication between the agent and the stealer task).
- Tests CI: don't wait for integration tests to start testing E2E tests.

### Fixed

- Add missing `fstat`/`lstat`/`fstatat`/`stat` hooks.

## 3.13.2

  - `fclose` was calling close which doesn't flush.

## 3.13.0

### Changed

- IntelliJ Plugin: downgrade Java to version 11.
- IntelliJ Plugin: update platform version to 2022.3.
- Disable progress in mirrord-layer - can cause issues with forks and generally confusing now
  that agent is created by cli (and soon to be created by IDE plugin via cli).
- Update to Frida 16.0.7
- Add more paths to the default ignore list (`/snap` and `*/.asdf/*`) - to fix asdf issues.
- Add `/bin/` to default ignore list - asdf should be okay now!

### Added

- mirrord-operator: Add securityContext section for deployment in operator setup

### Fixed

- Fix `--fs-mode=local` didn't disable hooks as it was supposed to.
- Fix hooking wrong libc functions because of lack of module specification - add function to resolve
  module name to hook from (libc on Unix,libsystem on macOS). Partially fixes asdf issue.

## 3.12.1

### Added

- E2E test for pause feature with service that logs http requests and a service that makes requests.
- mirrord-layer: automatic operator discovery and connection if deployed on cluster. (Discovery can be disabled with `MIRRORD_OPERATOR_ENABLE=false`).

### Changed

- Added `/tmp/` to be excluded from file ops by default. Fixes [#800](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/800).

### Misc

- Reformatted a bit the file stuff, to make it more readable. We now have `FILE_MODE` instead of `FILE_OPS_*` internally.
- Changed fileops test to also test write override (mirrord mode is read and override specific path)

## 3.12.0

### Added

- `--pause` feature (unstable). See [#712](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/712).
- operator setup cli feature.

- layer: panic on error instead of exiting without any message.
- CI: don't run CI on draft PRs.
- Update dependencies.
- Update to clap v4 (cli parser crate).
- Started deprecation of fsmode=disabled, use fsmode=local instead.

  the SIP binary.
  This means we now support running bash scripts with mirrord also on MacOS.
  Closes [#649](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/649).

### Changed

- Only warn about invalid certificates once per agent.
- Reduce tokio features to needed ones only.

### Fixed

### Fixed

- fix markdown job by adding the checkout action

## 3.7.3

### Fixed

- mirrord-agent: No longer resolves to `eth0` by default, now we first try to resolve
  the appropriate network interface, if this fails then we use `eth0` as a last resort.
  Fixes [#670](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/670).

### Changed

- intelliJ: use custom delve on macos

  See [#587](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/587) and [#667](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/667)

## 3.5.0

### Added

- aarch64 release binaries (no go support yet, no IntelliJ also).
- mirrord-layer: Add [`FileFilter`](mirrord-layer/src/file/filter.rs) that allows the user to include or exclude file paths (with regex support) for file operations.

### Changed

- mirrord-layer: Improve error message when user tries to run a program with args without `--`.
- Add tests for environment variables passed to KubeApi for authentication feature for cli credential fetch
- Remove openssl/libssl dependency, cross compilation is easier now. (It wasn't needed/used)
- mirrord-config: Changed the way [`fs`](mirrord-config/src/fs.rs) works: now it supports 2 modes `Simple` and `Advanced`,
  where `Simple` is similar to the old behavior (enables read-only, read-write, or disable file ops), and `Advanced`
  allows the user to specify include and exclude (regexes) filters for [`FileFilter`](mirrord-layer/src/file/filter.rs).
- Lint `README` and update it for `--target` flag.
- mirrord-layer: improve error message for invalid targets.

### Removed

- `--pod-name`, `--pod-namespace`, `--impersonated_container_name` have been removed in favor of `--target`, `--target-namespace`

- Tighter control of witch environment variables would be passed to the KubeApi when fetching credentials via cli in kube-config. See [#637](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/637)

### Fixed

- Lint Changelog and fix level of a "Changed" tag.
- File operations - following symlinks now works as expected. Previously, absolute symlinks lead to use our own path instead of target path.
  For example, AWS/K8S uses `/var/run/..` for service account credentials. In many machines, `/var/run` is symlink to `/run`
  so we were using `/run/..` instead of `/proc/{target_pid}/root/run`.
- Fix not reappearing window after pressing cancel-button in intelliJ extension.

## 3.3.0

### Added

- Telemetries, see [TELEMETRY.md](./TELEMETRY.md) for more information.

### Changed

- Extended support for both `-s` and `-x` wildcard matching, now supports `PREFIX_*`, `*_SUFFIX`, ect.
- Add to env default ignore `JAVA_HOME`,`HOMEPATH`,`CLASSPATH`,`JAVA_EXE` as it's usually runtime that you don't want
  from remote. Possibly fixes issue discussed on Discord (used complained that they had to use absolute path and not
  relative).
- Add `jvm.cfg` to default bypass for files.
- Clarify wrong target error message.
- mirrord-layer: Improve error message in `connection::handle_error`.

- Issue [#577](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/577). Changed non-error logs from `error!` to `trace!`.

### Changed

- Agent pod definition now has `requests` specifications to avoid being defaulted to high values.
  See [#579](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/579).
- Change VSCode extension configuration to have file ops, outgoing traffic, DNS, and environment variables turned on by
  default.
- update intelliJ extension: toggles + panel for include/exclude env vars

## 3.0.22-alpha

### Changed

- Exclude internal configuration fields from generated schema.

### Fixed

- Issue [#531](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/531). We now detect NixOS/Devbox usage and add `sh` to
  skipped list.

## 3.0.21-alpha

### Added

- Reuse agent - first process that runs will create the agent and its children will be able to reuse the same one to
  avoid creating many agents.
- Don't print progress for child processes to avoid confusion.
- Skip istio/linkerd-proxy/init container when mirroring a pod without a specific container name.
- Add "linkerd.io/inject": "disabled" annotation to pod created by mirrord to avoid linkerd auto inject.
- mirrord-layer: support `-target deployment/deployment_name/container/container_name` flag to run on a specific
  container.
- `/nix/*` path is now ignored for file operations to support NixOS.
- Shortcut `deploy` for `deployment` in target argument.
- Added the ability to override environment variables in the config file.

## 3.0.20-alpha

### Added

- `pread` hook (used by `dotnet`);
- mirrord-layer: ignore opening self-binary (temporal SDK calculates the hash of the binary, and it fails because it
  happens remotely)
- Layer integration tests with more apps (testing with Go only on MacOS because of
  known crash on Linux - [[#380](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/380)]).
  Closes [[#472](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/472)].
- Added progress reporting to the CLI.
- CI: use [bors](https://bors.tech/) for merging! woohoo.

### Changed

- Don't report InProgress io error as error (log as info)
- mirrord-layer: Added some `dotnet` files to `IGNORE_FILES` regex set;
- mirrord-layer: Added the `Detour` type for use in the `ops` modules instead of `HookResult`. This type supports
  returning a `Bypass` to avoid manually checking if a hook actually failed or if we should just bypass it;
- mirrord-protocol: Reduce duplicated types around `read` operation;
- Layer integration tests for more apps. Closes
  [[#472](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/472)].
- Rename http mirroring tests from `integration` to `http_mirroring` since there are
  now also integration tests in other files.
- Delete useless `e2e_macos` CI job.
- Integration tests also display test process output (with mirrord logs) when they
  time out.
- CI: mirrord-layer UT and integration run in same job.
- .devcontainer: Added missing dependencies and also kind for running e2e tests.

### Fixed

- Use LabelSelector instead of app=* to select pods from deployments
- Added another
  protection [to not execute in child processes from k8s auth](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/531) by
  setting an env flag to avoid loading then removing it after executing the api.

## 3.0.19-alpha

### Added

- Release image for armv7 (Cloud ARM)

  as `/proc/1/root` when the flag is on, otherwise `/`.
- Add support for Golang on amd64 (x86-64).

### Changed

- Assign a random port number instead of `61337`. (Reason: A forking process creates multiple agents sending traffic on
  the same port, causing addrinuse error.)

- Changed `addrinfo` to `VecDeque` - fixes a potential bug (loss of order)

## 2.4.1

### Added

  the handling to the peer logic, change structure of peer handling to a struct.
- Don't fail environment variable request if none exists.
- E2E: Don't assert jobs and pods length, to allow better debugging and less flakiness.
- Refactor(agent) - Main loop doesn't pass messages around but instead spawned peers interact directly with tcp sniffer.
  Renamed Peer -> Client and ClientID.
- Add context to agent/job creation errors (Fixes #112)

  pod.
- Mono repo
- Fixed unwraps inside
  of [agent-creation](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/blob/main/mirrord-layer/src/lib.rs#L75),
