# Change Log

All notable changes to the mirrord's cli, agent, protocol, extensions will be documented in this file.
Previous versions had CHANGELOG per component, we decided to combine all repositories to a mono-repo with one CHANGELOG.

Check [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) for recommendations on how to structure this file.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- mirrord-cli `exec` subcommand accepts `--extract-path` argument to set the directory to extract the library to. Used for tests mainly.
- mirrord-layer provides `MIRRORD_IMPERSONATED_CONTAINER_NAME` environment variable to specify container name to impersonate. mirrord-cli accepts argument to set variable.
- vscode-ext provides quick-select for setting `MIRRORD_IMPERSONATED_CONTAINER_NAME`

### Changed
- Refactor e2e, enable only Node HTTP mirroring test.
- E2E: add macOS to E2E, support using minikube by env var.
- E2E: Skip loading to docker before loading to minikube (load directly to minikube..)
- layer: Environment variables now load before process starts, no more race conditions.

### Fixed
- Support connections that start with tcp flags in addition to Syn (on macOS CI we saw CWR + NS)
- `fcntl` error on macOS [#184](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/184) by a workaround.

## 2.3.1

### Changed
- Refactor(agent) - change `FileManager` to be per peer, thus removing the need of it being in a different task, moving the handling to the peer logic, change structure of peer handling to a struct.
- Don't fail environment variable request if none exists.
- E2E: Don't assert jobs and pods length, to allow better debugging and less flakiness.
- Refactor(agent) - Main loop doesn't pass messages around but instead spawned peers interact directly with tcp sniffer. Renamed Peer -> Client and ClientID.
- Add context to agent/job creation errors (Fixes #112)
- Add context to stream creation error (Fixes #110)
- Change E2E to use real app, closes [#149](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/149)

## 2.3.0

### Added

- Add support for overriding a process' environment variables by setting `MIRRORD_OVERRIDE_ENV_VARS` to `true`. To filter out undesired variables, use the `MIRRORD_OVERRIDE_FILTER_ENV_VARS` configuration with arguments such as `FOO;BAR`.

### Changed

- Remove `unwrap` from the `Future` that was waiting for Kube pod to spin up in `pod_api.rs`. (Fixes #110)
- Speed up agent container image building by using a more specific base image.
- CI: Remove building agent before building & running tests (duplicate)
- CI: Add Docker cache to Docker build-push action to reduce build duration.
- CD release: Fix universal binary for macOS
- Refactor: Change protocol + mirrord-layer to split messages into modules, so main module only handles general messages, passing down to the appropriate module for handling.
- Add a CLI flag to specify `MIRRORD_AGENT_TTL`
- CI: Collect mirrord-agent logs in case of failure in e2e.
- Add "app" = "mirrord" label to the agent pod for log collection at ease.
- CI: Add sleep after local app finishes loading for agent to load filter make tests less flaky.
- Handle relative paths for open, openat
- Fix once cell renamings, PR [#98165](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/98165)
- Enable the blocking feature of the `reqwest` library 

## 2.2.1

### Changed

- Compile universal binaries for MacOS. (Fixes #131)
- E2E small improvements, removing sleeps. (Fixes #99)

## 2.2.0

### Added

- File operations are now available behind the `MIRRORD_FILE_OPS` env variable, this means that mirrord now hooks into the following file functions: `open`, `fopen`, `fdopen`, `openat`, `read`, `fread`, `fileno`, `lseek`, and `write` to provide a mirrored file system.
- Support for running x64 (Intel) binary on arm (Silicon) macOS using mirrord. This will download and use the x64 mirrord-layer binary when needed.
- Add detours for fcntl/dup system calls, closes [#51](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/51)

### Changed

- Add graceful exit for library extraction logic in case of error.
- Refactor the CI by splitting the building of mirrord-agent in a separate job and caching the agent image for E2E tests.
- Update bug report template to apply to the latest version of mirrord.
- Change release profile to strip debuginfo and enable LTO.
- VS Code extension - update dependencies.
- CLI & macOS: Extract to `/tmp/` instead of `$TMPDIR` as the executed process is getting killed for some reason.

### Fixed

- Fix bug that caused configuration changes in the VS Code extension not to work
- Fix typos

## 2.1.0

### Added

- Prompt user to update if their version is outdated in the VS Code extension or CLI.
- Add support for docker runtime, closes [#95](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/95).
- Add a keep-alive to keep the agent-pod from exiting, closes [#63](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/63)

## 2.0.4

Complete refactor and re-write of everything.

- The CLI/VSCode extension now use `mirrord-layer` which loads into debugged process using `LD_PRELOAD`/`DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`.
  It hooks some of the syscalls in order to proxy incoming traffic into the process as if it was running in the remote pod.
- Mono repo
