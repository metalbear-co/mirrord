# Getting Started

The following guide details the steps to setup a local development environment for mirrord and run the E2E tests.

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- Kubernetes Cluster (local/remote)

### Setup a Kubernetes cluster

For E2E tests and testing mirrord manually you will need a working Kubernetes cluster. A minimal cluster can be easily setup locally using either of the following:

- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)

For the ease of illustration and testing, we will conform to using Minikube for the rest of the guide.

### Minikube

Download [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/)

Start a Minikube cluster with preferred driver. Here we will use the Docker driver.

```bash
minikube start --driver=docker
```

### Prepare a cluster

 Build mirrord-agent Docker Image.
 
Make sure you're [logged in to GHCR](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).

Then run:
```bash
docker buildx build -t test . --file mirrord/agent/Dockerfile
```

```bash
❯ docker images
REPOSITORY                                     TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
test                                           latest    5080c20a8222   2 hours ago     300MB
```

> **Note:** mirrord-agent is shipped as a container image as mirrord creates a job with this image, providing it with
> elevated permissions on the same node as the impersonated pod.

Load mirrord-agent image to Minikube.

```bash
minikube image load test
```

Switch Kubernetes context to `minikube`.

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

```bash
kubectl config use-context minikube
```

## E2E Tests

The E2E tests create Kubernetes resources in the cluster that kubectl is configured to use and then run sample apps 
with the mirrord CLI. The mirrord CLI spawns an agent for the target on the cluster, and runs the test app, with the 
layer injected into it. Some test apps need to be compiled before they can be used in the tests 
([this should be automated in the future](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/982)).

The basic command to run the E2E tests is:
```bash
cargo test --package tests
```

However, when running on macOS a universal binary has to be created first:
```bash
scripts/build_fat_mac.sh
```

And then in order to use that binary in the tests, run the tests like this:
```bash
MIRRORD_TESTS_USE_BINARY=../target/universal-apple-darwin/debug/mirrord cargo test -p tests
```

### Cleanup

The Kubernetes resources created by the E2E tests are automatically deleted when the test exits. However, you can preserve resources from failed tests for debugging. To do this, set the `MIRRORD_E2E_PRESERVE_FAILED` variable to any value.

```bash
MIRRORD_E2E_PRESERVE_FAILED=y cargo test --package tests
```

All test resources share a common label `mirrord-e2e-test-resource=true`. To delete them, simply run:

```bash
kubectl delete namespaces,deployments,services -l mirrord-e2e-test-resource=true
```

## Integration Tests

The layer's integration tests test the hooks and their logic without actually using a Kubernetes cluster and spawning
an agent. The integration tests usually execute a test app and load the dynamic library of the layer into them. The 
tests set the layer to connect to a TCP/IP address instead of spawning a new agent. The tests then have to simulate the 
agent - they accept the layer's connection, receive the layers messages and answer them as the agent would.

Since they do not need to create Kubernetes resources and spawn agents, the integration tests complete much faster than 
the E2E tests, especially on GitHub Actions.

Therefore, whenever possible we create integration tests, and only resort to E2E tests when necessary.

### Running the Integration Tests

Some test apps need to be compiled before they can be used in the tests
([this should be automated in the future](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues/982)).

The basic command to run the integration tests is:
```bash
cargo test --package mirrord-layer
```

However, when running on macOS a dylib has to be created first:
```bash
scripts/build_fat_mac.sh
```

And then in order to use that dylib in the tests, run the tests like this:
```bash
MIRRORD_TEST_USE_EXISTING_LIB=../../target/universal-apple-darwin/debug/libmirrord_layer.dylib cargo test -p mirrord-layer
```

## Testing mirrord manually with a sample app.

From the root directory of the mirrord repository, create a new testing deployment and service:

```bash
kubectl apply -f sample/kubernetes/app.yaml
```

<details>
  <summary>sample/kubernetes/app.yaml</summary>

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment

### Build and run mirrord

To build this project, you will first need a [Protocol Buffer Compiler](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/) installed.

#### macOS
```bash
scripts/build_fat_mac.sh
```

#### Linux
```bash
cargo build
```

The binary is created at `./target/<platform>/debug/mirrord`

#### Run mirrord with a local process

Sample web server - `app.js` (present at `sample/node/app.mjs` in the repo)

<details>
  <summary>sample/node/app.mjs</summary>

```js
import { Buffer } from "node:buffer";
import { createServer } from "net";
import { open, readFile } from "fs/promises";

async function debug_file_ops() {
  try {
    const readOnlyFile = await open("/var/log/dpkg.log", "r");
    console.log(">>>>> open readOnlyFile ", readOnlyFile);

    let buffer = Buffer.alloc(128);
    let bufferResult = await readOnlyFile.read(buffer);
    console.log(">>>>> read readOnlyFile returned with ", bufferResult);

    const sampleFile = await open("/tmp/node_sample.txt", "w+");
    console.log(">>>>> open file ", sampleFile);

    const written = await sampleFile.write("mirrord sample node");
    console.log(">>>>> written ", written, " bytes to file ", sampleFile);

    let sampleBuffer = Buffer.alloc(32);
    let sampleBufferResult = await sampleFile.read(buffer);
    console.log(">>>>> read ", sampleBufferResult, " bytes from ", sampleFile);

    readOnlyFile.close();
    sampleFile.close();
  } catch (fail) {
    console.error("!!! Failed file operation with ", fail);
  }
}

// debug_file_ops();

const server = createServer();
server.on("connection", handleConnection);
server.listen(
  {
    host: "localhost",
    port: 80,
  },
  function () {
    console.log("server listening to %j", server.address());
  }
);

function handleConnection(conn) {
  var remoteAddress = conn.remoteAddress + ":" + conn.remotePort;
  console.log("new client connection from %s", remoteAddress);
  conn.on("data", onConnData);
  conn.once("close", onConnClose);
  conn.on("error", onConnError);

  function onConnData(d) {
    console.log("connection data from %s: %j", remoteAddress, d.toString());
    conn.write(d);
  }
  function onConnClose() {
    console.log("connection from %s closed", remoteAddress);
  }
  function onConnError(err) {
    console.log("Connection %s error: %s", remoteAddress, err.message);
  }
}

```

# Debugging mirrord

## mirrord console

Debugging mirrord can get hard since we're running from another app flow, so the fact we're debugging might affect the program and make it unusable/buggy (due to sharing stdout with scripts/other applications).

The recommended way to do it is to use `mirrord-console`. It is a small application that receives log information from different mirrord instances and prints it, controlled via `RUST_LOG` environment variable.

To use mirrord console, run it:
`cargo run --bin mirrord-console`

Then run mirrord with the environment variable:
`MIRRORD_CONSOLE_ADDR=127.0.0.1:11233`

## Retrieving Agent Logs

By default, the agent's pod will complete and disappear shortly after the agent exits. In order to be able to retrieve 
the agent's logs after it crashes, set the agent's pod's TTL to a comfortable number of seconds. This configuration can
be specified either as a command line argument (`--agent-ttl`), environment variable (`MIRRORD_AGENT_TTL`), or in a
configuration file:
```toml
[agent]
ttl = 30
```

Then, when running with some reasonable TTL, you can retrieve the agent log like this:
```bash
kubectl logs -l app=mirrord --tail=-1 | less -R
```

This will retrieve the logs from all running mirrord agents, so it is only useful when just one agent pod exists.

If there are currently multiple agent pods running on your cluster, you would have to run
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
and find the name of the agent pod you're interested in, then run

```bash
kubectl logs <YOUR_POD_NAME> | less -R
```

where you would replace `<YOUR_POD_NAME>` with the name of the pod.




# New Hook Guidelines

Adding a feature to mirrord that introduces a new hook (file system, network) can be tricky and there are a lot of edge cases we might need to cover. 

In order to have a more structured approach, here’s the flow you should follow when working on such a feature.

1. Start with the use case. Write an example use case of the feature, for example “App needs to read credentials from a file”.
2. Write a minimal app that implements the use case - so in the case of our example, an app that reads credentials from a file. Start with either Node or Python as those are most common.
3. Figure out what functions need to be hooked in order for the behavior to be run through the mirrord-agent instead of locally. We suggest using `strace`.
4. Write a doc on how you would hook and handle the cases, for example:
    1. To implement use case “App needs to read credentials from a file*”
    2. I will hook `open` and `read` handling calls only with flags O_RDONLY.
    3. Once `open` is called, I’ll send a blocking request to the agent to open the remote file, returning the return code of the operation. 
    4. Create an fd using `memfd`. The result will be returned to the local app, and if successful we’ll save that fd into a HashMap that matches between local fd and remote fd/identifier. 
    5. When `read` is called, I will check if the fd being read was previously opened by us, and if it is we’ll send a blocking `read` request to the agent. The result will be sent back to the caller.
    6. And so on.
5. This doc should go later on to our mirrord docs for advanced developers so people can understand how stuff works
6. After approval of the implementation, you can start writing code, and add relevant e2e tests.
