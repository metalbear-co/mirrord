# Telemetry / Analytics

mirrord sends anonymous usage statistics to our systems.
We don't store IP addresses, and we don't create any unique identifier for the user.

Data collected is session duration and what features were used (steal/mirror/fs mode, etc).
This helps us to improve the product and by better understanding our users.
Types of data sent:
1. Feature on/off
2. Feature enum value (steal/mirror, read/write)
3. Feature count (how many ports in listen_ports)

## Disabling

Telemetry can be disabled by specifying the following in the mirrord config file:
```json
{"telemetry": false}
```
