/// Configuration for mirrord features.
///
/// For more information, check the [technical reference](https://mirrord.dev/docs/reference/)
/// of the feature.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// - Exclude "SECRET" environment variable, enable read-write file operations, mirror network
///   traffic (default option), and generate a crash report (if there is any crash):
///
/// ```toml
/// # mirrord-config.toml
///
/// [feature]
/// fs = "write"
/// capture_error_trace = true
///
/// [feature.env]
/// exclude = "SECRET"
/// ```
///
/// - Include only "DATABASE_URL", and "PORT" environment variables, enable read-write file
///   operations (only for `.txt` files), and enable both incoming and outgoing network traffic
///   (mirror):
///
/// ```toml
/// # mirrord-config.toml
///
/// [feature.env]
/// include = "DATABASE_URL;PORT"
///
/// [feature.fs]
/// mode = "write"
/// include = "^.*\.txt$"
///
/// [feature.network]
/// incoming = "mirror" # default, included here for effect
///
/// [feature.network.outgoing]
/// tcp = true
/// udp = true
/// ```
