/// Stolen HTTPS requests can be delivered to the local application either as HTTPS or as plain HTTP
/// requests. Note that stealing HTTPS requests requires mirrord Operator support.
///
/// To have the stolen HTTPS requests delivered with plain HTTP, use:
///
/// ```json
/// {
///   "protocol": "tcp"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// To have the requests delivered with HTTPS, use:
/// ```json
/// {
///   "protocol": "tls"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// By default, the local mirrord TLS client will trust any certificate presented by the local
/// application's HTTP server. To override this behavior, you can either:
///
/// 1. Specify a list of paths to trust roots. These paths can lead either to PEM files or PEM file
///    directories. Each found certificate will be used as a trust anchor.
/// 2. Specify a path to the cartificate chain used by the server.
///
/// Example with trust roots:
/// ```json
/// {
///   "protocol": "tls",
///   "trust_roots": ["/path/to/cert.pem", "/path/to/cert/dir"]
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Example with certificate chain:
/// ```json
/// {
///   "protocol": "tls",
///   "server_cert": "/path/to/cert.pem"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// To make a TLS connection to the local application's HTTPS server,
/// mirrord's TLS client needs a server name. You can supply it manually like this:
/// ```json
/// {
///   "protocol": "tls",
///   "server_name": "my.test.server.name"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If you don't supply the server name:
///
/// 1. If `server_cert` is given, and the found end-entity certificate contains a valid server name,
///    this server name will be used;
/// 2. Otherwise, if the original client supplied an SNI extension, the server name from that
///    extension will be used;
/// 3. Otherwise, if the stolen request's URL contains a valid server name, that server name will be
///    used;
/// 4. Otherwise, `localhost` will be used.
